         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> and killed <hi>Iames</hi> the Brother of <hi>Iohn</hi> with the Sword;<note place="margin">

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:170034:12"/>ſaith, that the Accuſer of <hi>Iames</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his conſtancy to the Death, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the faith, and was Martyred with him; Saint <hi>Iames</hi> crying, <hi>Pax tibi,</hi> and kiſſing him. Well, <hi>Iames</hi> his death was ſeconded by <hi>Peters</hi> Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, but his time of Martyrdom was not yet come; <hi>Agrippa</hi> having ſeized on him deferred his Execution till after the Paſſover; either becauſe he would not defile that holy Feaſt with mans blood, or rather that he feared a Tumult, if he ſhould have ſlain him in that concourſe of people at the Paſſover time: In the mean time <hi>Peter</hi> lay guarded with 4. Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternions of Souldiers, bound with two Chains, and as ſome ſay, his two Keepers were tyed in the ſame Chain with him for ſureties ſake. That night which preceded <hi>Peters</hi> intended Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he being faſt aſſeep between his Keepers, was awakned, ſuddenly looſned, and ſtrangely delivered by an Angel: <hi>Peter</hi> and his Angel (being thus looſned) paſſed quietly through the firſt and ſecond Watch, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came to an iron Gate which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170034:12"/>to them of its own accord: <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> cleared of the Danger, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel diſ-appearing, betakes himſelfe to the houſe of <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>Iohn Mark,</hi> where the Diſciples were gathered together to pray for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, whilſt <hi>Peter</hi> knocked at the door, a Damſel (<hi>Rhoda</hi> by name) came to hearken and gather who it was, and when ſhe heard <hi>Peters</hi> Voice ſhe opened not the door for gladneſs, but ran in amazed and told them <hi>Peter</hi> was at the Gate; They charged her with madneſs, but ſhe conſtantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that it was no Deluſion: Then ſaid they, <hi>It is his Angel:</hi> The upſhot was this, <hi>Peter</hi> was received joyfully: And there was no ſmall ſtir among the Souldiers when they miſſed him; King <hi>Herod</hi> was ſo offended with this eſcape, that he cauſed the innocent Keepers to be examined and put to death.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the whole Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Eminent Deliverance of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> laid before you; And from the whole Hiſtory we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve many things. As</p>

            <p n="2">2. The Churches Enemies are full of policy in the midſt of cruelty: <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was not preſently muthered, for fear of a Tumult: They ſuck in the craft of the old Serpent, they lean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their wiſdom; and as little Boyes they ſtand upon their heads, and ſhake their heels againſt Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Cloſe Impriſonment is a ſore ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Perſecution, and he that peeps through the iron Grates doth beſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpy the beauty of Liberty.</p>

            <p n="9">9. The Saints will readily own and receive a perſecuted Member: The Diſciples received <hi>Peter</hi> joyfully, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it might have coſt them their lives: A friend is born for adverſity.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Somtimes the deliverances
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170034:16"/>of Gods people out of imminent, emminent dangers, are ſo wonderfull, and attended with ſuch a Train of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Improbabilities, that they have much ado to believe them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they hear and ſee them. The Diſciples took that for the Eve of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Execution, and they well knew he was guarded with four Quater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Souldiers, was bound with two Chains, and that if he could eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape out of Priſon, and paſs the firſt and ſecond watch, there was yet a Gate and that of Iron, that would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his aime; Therfore when he was delivered and ſtood knocking at the Gate, through incredulity, they let him ſtand ſo long, that he might have been re-taken at the door, and the ſhip ſink in the Havens mouth: <hi>Rhoda</hi> though ſhe heard his voice, is charged with madneſs for ſaying ſo,<note place="margin">Calvin in Locum.</note> and at laſt they ſaid it was his Angel; in Summe, any thing rather then the Apoſtle. <hi>Hinc colligimus Petri liberatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me fuiſſe ab illis ſperatam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> on the Text; They little dreamt of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> deliverance. When the three
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170034:17"/>Children were preſerved in the hot fiery Furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> ſafe in the Lions Den, their Enemies who ſaw it could hardly beleeve it. Nay, Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (as well as others) have been at a loſs in this thing; when Chriſt, that great Anſwer of prayer was come in the Fleſh, how few did beleive in him? when he came to his Diſciples in the Ship, to ſave them from the Tempeſt, they cryed out for fear, ſuppoſing he was a Spirit; And when he was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from the dead, the Apoſtle <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> though he ſaw him and conferred with him, could not beleive but muſt put his Fingers into the prints of the Nails.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170034:22"/>without ceaſing of the Church unto God for him.</hi> So that thoſe many gathered together in Prayer (<hi>verſe the</hi> 12) were doubtleſſe the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where were very many Chriſtians: They met indeed together in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſe, becauſe they had not the Liberty of any Publique Aſſemblies.

            </p>
            <p>The Generall conſent and Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of people (cheifly if knowing and good) is very much to be heeded; For oftentimes. <hi>Vox populi eſt Vox Dei:</hi> I am ſure that which Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, untainted with Hereſy, ſo neer the Fountaine of Truth maintained as Orthodox, with unanimous conſent; is not by us to be ſlighted, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved.</p>
            <p>Secondly an other circumſtance is the time and place,<note place="margin">2 <hi>The time &amp; place.</hi>
               </note> when and where

                  <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5.12.</note> for that end: Now certainly Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Fables, and inconſiderat Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies would little become ſo many Chriſtians in a time of Prayer, and in a place, which though private in it ſelfe, ceaſed to be private, fo long as the Church was there and then aſſembled. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, There is a Time to weep and a time to laugh; ſo I may affirme, There is a time to be merrily diſpoſed, and declare the conceipts and fancies of men; And a time to watch over the Tongue, and buckle the Heart to all gravity and ſoberneſs.<note place="margin">Senec.</note>

               </gap>; unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things are abſurd, and will diſpleaſe God and good men. We gather then from the time and place of uttering the Text; that it was the received judgement and Doctrine of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note n="3" place="margin">The manner of ſpeaking.</note> an other Circumſtance may be drawn from the Manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, which was not conjecturall or doubting, but poſitive and expreſs; in few,<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> not many words; <hi>It is his Angell.

            <p>'Twas I ſay Recorded by Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> an eminent and holy Evangeliſt; who did not record all things that paſſed, but the moſt weighty and materiall, both in the Goſpell and Acts of the Apoſtles: Though he was not an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle yet Apoſtolical; ſaith <hi>Tertullian.</hi>

               <hi>That a Church of moſt ſerious, knowing and devout Chriſtians, being met together for Prayer and Faſting,

            <p>Now unto all this I anſwer, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is very probable that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching the blind man, was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Vulgar Opinion of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration, yet it from thence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that our Text here was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the like manner; in regard of the forementioned circumſtances of time, place, and manner of ſpeaking it: For the Diſciples being now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſo ſolemn Devotions, could not probably be ſuppoſed guilty of ſo much Freedom, if not Levity, at ſuch a time and in ſuch a place as we have obſerved already.</p>

            <p>Having given the Reader the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gloſſes and chief interpretations of this Text, we come now to our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall concluſion from the words.</p>
            <p>Every Elect perſon hath his Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-angel,<note place="margin">Theſis.</note> who by particular Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is allotted to be his faithfull Keeper, and Tutor, and vigilant Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat to his lives end.</p>
            <p>I ſay Elect perſons, and ſuch only, ſaith <hi>Origen,</hi> as are <hi>Praecogniti a Deo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.14.</note> They are to attend the Heirs of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: All ſuch are dear to God, and there be Angels enow to guard them.</p>
            <p>Every Elect perſon hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and tuition of confirmed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to ſhield him, and to ſtave off e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Spirits from him.</p>
            <p>Every Elect hath one particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that watcheth over him, God hath a generall care of the World, but a more particular care of his Saints, who are his Jewels, the Apple of his eye, the Signet on his hand.</p>
            <p>This Angel is allotted and aſſigned
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170034:28"/>by God to his particular charge, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Angel knows his Office and his Place: They all act by Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for God is the God of order and not of confuſion.</p>
            <p>This Angel is to be his Keeper, his wiſe Counſellor, his faithfull and ſtrong Defender; his moſt loving and friendly Aſſociat.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Angel is not utterly to depart from him, till his Pilgrimage and Warfare be ended.</p>
            <p>Now the main Branch which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires confirmation, and in treating of which the reſt will fall in, is this; That every Elect perſon hath one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Angel to guard him.</p>
            <p>But firſt to ſhut out all Prejudice, three things will by us all be moſt eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That many rich Myſteries are lockt up in the Nature of Angels, which by degrees will break out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we abhor with greateſt Deteſtation the Adoration of Angels.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That we muſt not exclude a multitude of Angels from extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary attendance for our greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170034:28"/>in ſome ſtreights: And theſe things will eternally ſtop the mouth of moſt Arguments againſt this Truth.</p>
            <p>The firſt is to ſatisfie the Ignorant, who will ſtumble at this Point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in darkneſs and never heard it before.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is to ſilence our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of Romiſh Intereſt, who may hope that the Needle of this diſcourſe inclines to draw in the rotten Thred of Adoration.</p>
            <p>The third is to prepare the Godly, Learned, and Orthodox, who chiefly in oppoſition to <hi>Rome</hi> have denyed this point; That they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuſpend their Objections, and meekly to conſider what is here writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>The firſt Conceſſion is this,<note n="1" place="margin">Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> that many Myſteries are lockt up in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels, which by degrees will break forth. Among all the Creatures that God made in the ſix daies, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> doth not once mention the Angels of Heaven; ſhall we therfore be Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces and believe there is no Angel nor Spirit? Twas a long time before
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170034:29"/>thoſe great Myſteries of the Nature, Offices, and Degrees of Angels did break forth; before the Headſhip of Jeſus Chriſt over them, and their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py confirmation by him (after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fell as Lightning from Heaven) was the uſuall talk and diſcourſe of the church of God: ſtrang things are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of Angels; as their Languages, Names, Songs, Battels, their converſe w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> one another; viſions of God, their Motions, Number, and Ranks. What means the receiving of the Law by the Depoſition of Angels? Or the Angels ſtriving with the Divell about <hi>Moſes</hi> his body?

            <p>I have given you the Preparatory Conceſſions, and am come at laſt to demonſtrate our Theſis, and to prove that every elect Child of God hath one particular Angel to tutor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him.

            <p>If it be replyed that Chriſt is called <hi>the Angell of the Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3.1. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt is indeed called an Angell in Scripture, but ſeldom without a note of Difference; To let you know he is more then all Angells; ſo he is called the <hi>Head of Angells,</hi> and <hi>the Angell of the Covenant.</hi>

            <p>Again it is objected, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> This Angell mentioned by old <hi>Jacob</hi> is joyned in Bleſſing with God, therefore it is Chriſt, not an Angel: Beſides the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel with whom <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">Gen. 31.</note> 'tis like was this Angel.

            <p>God bleſſeth and redeemeth effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; Angels and Men inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally: If this were ſpoken of eternall Redemption, it were peculiar to Chriſt; but <hi>Jacob</hi> here ſpeaketh of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Deliverance from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Evils, which is confeſſed to be a main office of Angels:<note place="margin">Pſ. 91.11.</note> Therefore <hi>Mercerius</hi> ſaith, it was an Angel to whom <hi>Jacob</hi> aſcribeth his Deliverance as to Gods Miniſter. Who is there that doubteth whether Miniſters or Paſtors may bleſſe their people, Parents their children? (as old <hi>Jacob</hi> here bleſſeth <hi>Joſeph</hi>) If ſo, then certainly Angels may inſtrumentally be ſaid to bleſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170034:36"/>and do us good, as well as men.</p>
            <p>But how doth it appear that this Angel was he with whom <hi>Jacob</hi> wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtled long before? when it is plain that he was prayed to by <hi>Jacob,</hi> and was called, <hi>The God of Bethel:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 31.13 32.</note> But this Angel is neither prayed to, nor ſtiled God: Only in bleſſing <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth that God and his Angel may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bleſſe them; The one in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a bleſſing, and the other in the execution of Gods will.</p>
            <p>'Tis again objected; <label type="milestone">

            <p n="2">2. At <hi>Iacobs</hi> death (he being now very old) that Angel of his would wholly be free, and at liberty to help them.</p>

            <p>Laſtly, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>4</label> it is objected, that <hi>Iacob</hi> met an Hoſt of Angels ſent for his defence, and he accordingly called the place <hi>Mahanaim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 32.1</note> (that is, two Hoſts, or two Camps) Therefore ſome haſtily conclude, <hi>Iacob</hi> had not ONE Angel to guard him.</p>
            <p>But this is no conſequence; For as a King ſometimes appeareth with a vaſt or ſtately Retinue, and at other times is alone with a ſpeciall Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: So it was with <hi>Iacob;</hi> in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſes two hoſts of Angels were about him, and yet he might have one Angell for ordinary and hourly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, which was ſufficient; of which more in its place.</p>
            <p>So that you ſee (the Objections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed) that an Angel was <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> Guardian, for he redeemed him

            <p n="1">1. It is thus gloſſed by ſome: <label type="milestone">

            <p n="1">1 Offend them not, do not deſpiſe or undervalue them:<note n="†" place="margin">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170034:40"/>us be careful how we deſpiſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Angels Deputation: For if it be unſafe to deſpiſe the Chriſtians ſo attended, it will be more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to contemn the Doctrine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are ſecured: For in ſlighting this Doctrine, take heed leaſt yee be found among the ſlighters of Chriſt, who delivered it.

That he might be aſſured it was his Angel, the Angel aſſumed a bodily ſhape, a light ſhining in the Priſon, and he ſpake to <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſmote off his chaines. 5. He was herein much confirmed in our point: Now I know
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170034:43"/>for a certaine it is ſo and ſo: Oh that ſuch as out of zeal againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; in pangs of miſtaken zeal, do oppoſe with ſome bitternes this truth, would pauſe, ponder, and conſider the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Scriptures; Then would we ſay with <hi>Peter,</hi> Now we know for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that God ſends unto his ſervants, and to each of them a tutelar Angel to defend and direct them. Now the objections againſt this laſt Scripture, were anſwered in the ſeverall expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Text, and therefore here we ſhall paſſe them over.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly,<note n="3" place="margin">The Point by conſent of ancient &amp; modern Writers.</note> we come now to give you the confirmation of this point, by the joynt aſſent of many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern Writers, untainted with Popiſh leven: And here we ſhall conſider two things. 1. That this evidence is not vain. 2. That of theſe evidences there are ſtore.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the judgment of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>viz.</hi> of learned, pious, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Writers in ſeverall ages, doth tend very much to the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Scripture-truth: We doe not ſay that<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Iohn Daille <hi>of the right uſe of the Fathers.</hi>
               </note> Antiquity, the opinion
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170034:43"/>of the Fathers, and humane tradition are infallible ſigns &amp; pillars of Truth, or that they are equall with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that Generall Councels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre; Or finally, that there is not ſuch a thing as Antiquity of Errour: But this wee ſafely may affirm, That the judgment of holy, learned, and unbyaſt men is not a little to be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and doth exceedingly conduce to the clearing of Scripture-truth, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſettle and eſtabliſh us in the true meaning of Gods word.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15.</note> The Church is called <hi>The pillar and ground of truth:</hi> Not ſo much a Marble pillar to ſupport the Truth, as a pillar on which is Paſted the Proclamation of Divine Truths. That the judgment of the Learned and Orthodox is not to be neglected, will thus eaſily appear unto us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The tranſlation of the Bible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeverall Languages hath ſtill beene highly valued in Gods Church: The generality of Gods People have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bible to peruſe but that which is cloathed in their Mother tongue; on this Bible they build their ſalvation:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170034:44"/>Nay, the moſt learned Linguiſts doe know the ſignification of Greek and Hebrew words only upon credit of their Teachers and Authors: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo the Expoſition of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by the ſame, or like-learned, or ſound men, is not to be ſuſpected or vilipended in Gods Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have ſtrong and ſollid proofs of the things that they hold, well back'd with Scripture &amp; Reaſon, and intermixt with fervent exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Piety.</p>
            <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.20.</note> If we muſt regard the Sermons, Expoſitions, and Writings of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, then ſurely much more of the Dead, ſince the Living may recant and depart from their preſent perſwaſions; but the other have conveyed that to us which was their Belief both in life and death: Surely the experiences of Gods people, whether here, or in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are of marvellous uſe and rich benefit to the Saints.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Their joynt conſent, unity and harmony in things fundamentall, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that they were acted, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the ſame ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:170034:44"/>5. Their difference in leſſer things, is ſo farre from abating the weight of their Teſtimony, as that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it addes<note n="†" place="margin">Jo: Daille <hi>of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, book</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 186.</note> rather much unto the ſame: For this clears their conſenting in things Fundamental from all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proceeding from Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Mutual Intelligence, and the thing which is now ſtiled Intereſt: For when you find them diſagreeing in many leſſer things, it is an evident ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that they have not altogether ſucked their knowledg from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or combined together to deceive us: But according to their beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings they drew all from the Fountaine, hewing out each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar point from the rich quarry of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, ſo far as God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale his will to them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Many eyes ſee more then two: But the Orthodox<note n="a" place="margin">Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius <hi>had ſo high an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of Conncels, That writing of the</hi> Nycene <hi>Councell, he ſaith thus:</hi> An non igitur Peccant iſti, ſi vel cogitent tantum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicere tam celebri totius orbis Synodo? <hi>Athan. De Decret. Nicen. Synod. p.</hi> 318.</note> Councels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of many eminent Lights, and a conſtellation of many gliſtering Suns,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170034:45"/>gathered from Remote parts, earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly ſeeking God by Prayer and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting: And ſo by their Learned and Orderly Diſputations (as from the colliſion of ſeverall flints) many ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of Truth and Light did breake forth.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And laſtly, Many did not only Preach, but diſpute for, and pen down what the Lord had revealed unto them; ſome of them uſing Red inke, and ſealing the Truth which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted with their blood; As <hi>Ignatius, Policarp, Cyprian, Origen, Huſs,</hi> and many others, who amidſt all their tortures would not let go the Truth, as well knowing that the Vine of Gods Church doth bravely flouriſh after it hath been well watered with blood: Perſecutors that burned their bodies, could not utterly conſume their Writings.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to prove that the judgement of Learned and ſound Writers is of great uſe for the clearing up of Scripture-truth.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170034:50"/>conclude it was never preached by Chriſt or his Apoſtles: For what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability is there that thoſe holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of former Ages, from whoſe hands Chriſtianity hath been derived down to us, ſhould be ignorant of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe things which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and concern our Salvation?

Well, towards the end of the World, theſe Truths ſhall grow more Refulgent; God will vindicate and diſcover many things that as yet do ſeem dark in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; The way of Diſcipline ſhall grow plain, and many Propheſies ſhal not be fully underſtood till unveyl'd by fulfilling.

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Angels know not the Decrees, nor who are elected and choſen of God; Before that Election be declared in Converſion: But we anſwer God can ſoon reveal it unto thme.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:170034:66"/>2. Becauſe, <hi>In tempore Infidelitatis Homo eſt ſub Angelis Satanae.</hi> In the ſtate of Nature a man is under the wrath of God, and is vexed with evill Spirits that hurry him to ſin, and rule in the Children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I anſwer, Although this cannot be denyed, and that Elect Angels do not delight in mens ſins, nor in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the wicked; yet God is reſolved that all his Elect ſhall have inviſible ſupports againſt Satan, to preſerve them charily as choſen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, againſt the time that he ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf unto them: And then it is ſufficient to Angels that God wills their attendance, and that hereafter they ſhall diſcern ſome fruit of their care, when they come to rejoyce at the converſion of thoſe whom they attend: And in the mean time as the Sun is not polluted by looking into Sinks; ſo Angels are not polluted or diſquieted with the ſin of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others think the Guardian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is placed at Baptiſme: <hi>Origen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting many opinions doth menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, which is very improbable:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170034:67"/>For then the Penitent Theef who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Baptiz'd had no Guardian Angel to watch over him: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is then in the diſcretion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (who ſet the time of Baptiſme) when the Angel ſhall begin his Office o're the Child. The Elect are preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dear to God before as after that Ordinance, which is a Seal but no cauſe of Gods love: The contempt of it is dangerous, but the obſervation of it, is not meritorious. Away then with that egregious miſtake of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that Children dying unbaptized do periſh eternally. Baptiſme is either <hi>Flaminis</hi> or <hi>Fluminis;</hi> of the Flame or Flood, of the Water, or its Author: Elect Infants cannot want the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſme of Fire, and of the Spirit. Out of Chriſts ſide came water and blood; and he that hath Chriſt, hath both Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Millions are baptized with water that neither have Angel here, nor Heaven hereafter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Moſt think it is done at the Birth of an Elect; God revealing to the Angels who are ſuch, by requiring
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170034:67"/>their attendance on them that are his. Of this opinion <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeakes among others. The Rhemiſts ſay,<note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. That we owe much to them that are deare to God; It is for their ſakes that God aſſigned Angels to defend any Nation: Believers are the marble Pillars of a State. The whole ſhip, and all the wicked Saylors in it were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for St. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſake; If there had been a few righteous men in <hi>Sodome,</hi> it had not been deſtroyed.</p>

               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:170034:95"/>2. This conſideration may ſerve to comfort us; If at any time we ſee the foundations of the earth out of courſ, the pillars of Kingdoms to be ſhaken, and the wicked ſtriving to bear ſway, and trample Religion, Order, and Government (according to Law) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot. There are yet in ſuch King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms more and greater with, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lords People.</p>

            <p n="4">4. We muſt pray to God, that he would cauſe his celeſtiall Principalities and Powers to encircle thoſe who ſit at the ſtern, to keep them from law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe liberty and Libertines, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them to act faithfully and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly for the uſe of Church and State.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, This may quiet us in the many great mutations and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the frame of civill Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Let us hope the Lord is yet bringing great and good things to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170034:96"/>paſſe for us. Let not any repine and murmure, and hanker after the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Fleſh-pots of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and turn arrant Unbelievers &amp; Apoſtates, as do too many, the more is the pitty; Miſtruſt not the continuation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence over us; God is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying the Nation <hi>from veſſell to veſſell,</hi> till our filthy dregs be purged out: If the motions of a little Sparrow be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Providence, then much more the mighty turnings of Nations and Kingdoms are diſpoſed and over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Chriſt and his holy Angels.

            <p>Indeed Magnificent Cities rebelling againſt God have been brought to deſolation; As in the caſe of<note n="*" place="margin">Jam Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges eſt ubi Troia fuit.</note>

                  <hi>That wicked men have their evill Angels.
